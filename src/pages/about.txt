    <p class="mb-10 text-justify">
      We are the Boop Society of Central Texas, a non-profit organization
      dedicated to aiding organizational support for local, social, and
      educational events in the Central Texas area. We host 3 monthly social
      events, quarterly educational workshops, moshes, find volunteers to aid
      setting up events, and help assess locations and organizations for
      suitable safe spaces to ensure that they have the equipment necessary to
      safely host and promote pet play. We accept all critters (pups, kittens,
      ponies, dragons, and any other species, existing or imagined) and lovers
      of regardless of gender, sexuality, and background and help them find the
      best ways for them to live their best critter life. We hope to be a
      resource for any information a pet player may be looking for, and always
      look to help facilitate anything a pet player wants to make happen when we
      can.
